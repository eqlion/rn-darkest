# Why?

At the time of creating this app, I could not find a convenient Android app that could supply me with information about Darkest Dungeon (what provision to buy, how to interact with certain cuirios). Those that exist are ether buggy and slow, or contain a lot of annoying ads, or do not use Google's Material Design guideline. To solve this issue while learning JS and React on practice I decided to create the app.

# TODO

1. Actually integrate Redux

2. Add dark theme

3. Reorganize loading images

4. Add tips on what would be effective during the expedition

5. Restructure curio interaction outcomes in order to increase clarity
